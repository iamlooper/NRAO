# NRAO (Non root android optimizer) 🚀
A non-root android optimizer, as the name tells. Powered by [Shizuku](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.privileged.api).

## Usage 🔢
After downloading the zip from given sources, rename downloaded zip to `NRAO.zip`, execute the following code in Termux but make sure that the zip is in Internal Storage / Download:
```
termux-setup-storage
sh <path to rish file> # Start Shizuku shell.
mkdir -p /sdcard/Download/NRAO
unzip -qo /sdcard/Download/NRAO.zip -d /sdcard/Download/NRAO
sh /sdcard/Download/NRAO/run.sh
```
Do this again after every reboot because currently there is no automated method to execute NRAO on every reboot.

## Download 📲
You can download NRAO from the following:
- [Pling](https://www.pling.com/p/2033220)

## Notes 🗒️
- Device may overheat while execution.
- Make sure to reboot device before updating NRAO to flush previous tweaks.
- Every device is not compatible so kindly note this before giving feedback.
- Don't expect any black magic to occur so that your device suddenly transforms into ROG Phone 6.
